The problem of plagiarism poses significant challenges in educational settings, as it compromises the authenticity of academic work. By claiming the ideas and efforts of others as their own, students not only engage in dishonest practices but also miss out on valuable opportunities to learn and grow intellectually. To combat this, many schools and universities are adopting strict measures and employing sophisticated tools to identify plagiarism, emphasizing the importance of originality and creative expression in academic pursuits.
